HOW TO CREATE AND RUN SCALA PROGRAM IN INTELLIJ
===============================================

In this example we'll create a Scala program that
prints "Hello World" to the screen.

1) Launch Intellij

2) Press "New Project" button if that's visible on a dialog window,
   or select from the menu:  File / New / Project

3) On the dialog window that appears, select "Java" in the left column.
   (Do NOT select "Scala" in the left column!)

   On the left side of the dialog window:
      * Project SDK: Select a Java JDK from the dropdown.
      * Check the "Scala" checkbox.
      * Use library: Select a Scala SDK to use.

   Press the "Next" button.

4) On the new dialog window that appears enter, for example:

   Project name:      Demo
   Project location:  ~/IdeaProjects/Scala

   Press the "Finish" button.

5) Under the Scala project just created (named "Demo" in this example),
   right-click on the "src" folder.

   On the pop-up menu that appears, select:  Create New Scala Class
   On the pop-up dialog window that appears...

      * Select the type of class, object, or trait you want.
        In this example:  Object
      * Type the name of that class, object, or trait.
        In this example: "Demo"
      * Press the Enter key.

6) Now enter Scala code on the screen.  In this example:

   object Demo
   {
      def main(args: Array[String])
      {
         println("Hello World!") 
      }
   }

7) To run the program, on the left side of the screen,
   right-click on the folder:  Scala / src / Demo

   From the drop-down menu select:  Run 'Demo'
   
   The text "Hello World!" should print in the bottom window.

   AFTER this step is done, you can now run this program by
   pressing the green arrow icon in the upper-right screen.

THE END.
