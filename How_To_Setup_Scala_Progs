HOW TO SETUP INTELLIJ TO CREATE SCALA PROGRAMS
==============================================

This example shows how to setup Intellij so you can
create and run Scala programs.  Once Intellij is
setup properly, a Scala "Hello World" program is
run to confirm it's working.

1) Download a Java JDK that works with the Scala
   version you will be using.  In this example
   the Java JDK is installed in this location:

   /home/tjb/Tom/software_installs/jdk-11.0.13

2) Open up your .bashrc file in a text editor, and enter
   this text at the bottom of the file:

   export JAVA_HOME=/home/tjb/Tom/software_installs/jdk-11.0.13
   export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

3) Launch Intellij to select the Scala SDK Plugin that will
   be used.  From the menu, select:  File / Settings

   In the dialog window that appears, select "Plugins"
   in the LEFT column.  Then select "Marketplace" at
   top of the dialog window.  Find the Scala plugin
   to use and install it.

4) Press "New Project" button if that's visible on a dialog window.
   Or, select from the menu:  File / New / Project

5) On the dialog window that appears, select "Java" in the LEFT column.
   (Do NOT select "Scala" in the LEFT column!!!)

   On the RIGHT side of the dialog window:
      * Project SDK: Select a Java JDK from the dropdown.
      * Check the "Scala" checkbox.
      * Use library: Select a Scala SDK to use.

   Press the "Next" button.

6) On the new dialog window that appears enter, for example:

   Project name:      Demo
   Project location:  ~/IdeaProjects/Scala/Demo

   Press the "Finish" button.

7) Under the Scala project just created (named "Demo" in this example),
   right-click on the "src" folder located under the "Demo" folder.

   On the pop-up menu that appears, select:  New / Scala Class
   On the pop-up dialog window that appears...

      * Select the type of class, object, or trait you want.
        In this example:  Object
      * Type the name of that class, object, or trait.
        In this example: Demo
      * Press the Enter key.

8) Now enter Scala code on the screen.  In this example:

   object Demo
   {
      def main(args: Array[String])
      {
         println("Hello World!") 
      }
   }

9) To run the program, on the left side of the screen,
   right-click on the folder:  Demo / src / Demo

   From the drop-down menu select:  Run 'Demo'
   
   The program should run and print the text "Hello World!"
   in the bottom window.

   AFTER this step is done, you can now run this program by
   pressing the green arrow icon in the upper-right screen.

THE END.
